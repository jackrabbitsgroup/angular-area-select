# 1.0.1-2
## Features
- `$scope.$on('jrgAreaSelectReInit',..` event listener added for re-initializing the directive (after it's already been written) - i.e. if the transcluded inner content changes
- add `$attrs.inline`

## Bug Fixes
- switch from `getBoundingClientRect()` which was giving bad (negative/wrong) offset/coords
